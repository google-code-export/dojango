#How to install, setup and get the dojango test page running

=Introduction=

Dojango is a reusable django application that helps you to use the client-side
framework dojo within your django project. It provides capabilites to easily
switch between several dojo versions and sources (e.g. aol, google, local) and
delivers helping utilities, that makes the development of rich internet
applications in combination with dojo more comfortable. Also it makes the building
of your own packed dojo release easier. Another goal of this project is, that you
can learn how you have to structure your html to use dojo within your projects.


=Start your first dojango driven django project=

This section describes, how you integrate dojango on the basis of a newly
created django project. Django with at least version >= 0.96.2 must be installed
before to run dojango successfully. Details how you install django can be found
here::

http://www.djangoproject.com/download/
http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/install/

==Start an empty project==

Type the following on your console to create an empty django project::

{{{
django-admin.py startproject mysite
}}}

==Add dojango as app to your project==

Download the dojango-xxx.tar.gz from the google code page and place it in
your previously created django project directory and extract it there::

{{{
1. cd [mysite project directory]
2. tar xzvf dojango-xxx.tar.gz
}}}

You could also use an actual subversion checkout from::

http://svn.googlecode..........

and place it in your [mysite project directory].

After that you can enable the dojango app by defining the following in your
project's settings file ([mysite project directory]/settings.py)::

{{{
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'dojango',
)
}}}

==Enable the dojango URLs==

To deliver the media files you also have to add the URL definitions of dojango
to your main URL defintion file ([mysite project directory]/urls.py)::

{{{
urlpatterns = patterns('',
...
(r'^dojango/', include('dojango.urls')),
)
}}}

Consider, that if you want to set a different base pattern than ''dojango'', you
should also modify the DOJANGO_BASE_MEDIA_URL setting.

Now you are ready to start your django server::

{{{
./manage.py runserver
}}}

Open the dojango test page::

http://localhost:8000/dojango/test/

And enjoy dojo :-)

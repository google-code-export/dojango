#summary How to configure dojango.

=Configuration of dojango=

Dojango was designed to get started very fast, but you also have the power to configure
everything on your own (just if you really want to :-)). All the definitions below
can be set in your project's ''settings.py'' file::

==DOJANGO_DOJO_PROFILE (default "aol")==

Sets the dojango profile, that should be used within the dojango context. Possible values::

  * "aol" (default)
  * "aol_uncompressed"
  * "aol_gfx"
  * "aol_gfx_uncompressed"
  * "google"
  * "google_uncompressed"
  * "local"
  * "local_release"
  * "local_release_uncompressed"

==DOJANGO_DOJO_VERSION (default "1.1.1")==

This setting defines the dojo version that should be used within dojango. For the local
version you can pass in any value, because dojango tries to get a local version from
the following directory::

[mysite project directory]/dojango/media/dojo/[DOJANGO_DOJO_VERSION]

At the moment dojango is packed with dojo version 1.1.1 so that a local build process
is possible out-of-the-box.

All other external (crossdomain builds) just provide the following versions::

  * "1.1.1" - available in profile: all aol and google versions
  * "1.1.0" - available in profile: all aol versions
  * "1.0.2" - available in profile: all aol versions
  * "1.0.0" - available in profile: all aol versions
  * "0.9.0" - available in profile: all aol versions

==DOJANGO_DOJO_PROFILES==

With this setting you can extend the default list of profiles delivered with
dojango (see above). Loot at ''conf/settings.py'' on how to define your own
profile.

==DOJANGO_DOJO_THEME (default: "tundra")==

Here you can define the dojo theme, that should be used. Possible values::

  * "tundra"
  * "soria"
  * "nihilo"

==DOJANGO_DOJO_THEME_URL (defaults to the dijit theme URL)==

You can set your own theme base URL. It defaults to [dojo base url]/dijit/themes
and there you can look at the dojo theme structure, e.g.::

[dojo base url]/dijit/themes/tundra
[dojo base url]/dijit/themes/tundra/tundra.css
...


==DOJANGO_DOJO_DEBUG (default: settings.DEBUG)==

Turning dojo into debug mode. The standard is using the DEBUG setting of your
django project. Possible values::

  * True
  * False

==Several advanced settings for some URLs and paths==

Be careful if you modify the following settings. You really should know what you
are doing, if you are changing these.

===DOJANGO_BASE_MEDIA_URL (default: ''/dojango/media'')===

This sets the absolute URL to the media files of dojango. All dojo files
reside below that.

===DOJANGO_BUILD_MEDIA_URL (default: DOJANGO_BASE_MEDIA_URL + "/release")===

What is the base url when the dojango profile "local_release" is used? A builded
release will be available there in a directory with the name of the builded version.
See ''Settings for building your own dojo profile'' for details about building
dojo releases.

===DOJANGO_BASE_MEDIA_ROOT (default: [mysite project directory]/dojango/media)===

With this setting you can define the absolute path to the media files of dojango.
You have to change that, if you want to modify the dojo build system.

===DOJANGO_BASE_DOJO_ROOT (default: DOJANGO_BASE_MEDIA_ROOT + "/dojo")===

Like DOJANGO_BASE_MEDIA_ROOT, but defining the absolute base path to the media
files of dojo.

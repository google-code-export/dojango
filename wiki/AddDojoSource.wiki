#summary Help - How to add your own dojo source version and to enable custom builds.

=Add a dojo source version to dojango=

This document describes, what steps you have to take to enable the local dojango
profile that is using a source version of dojo. After performing the following steps 
you are also able doing your own DojoBuild.

*New since version 0.4*: Manage command extension for downloading a dojo source release:

{{{
./manage.py dojoload --dojo_version=1.3.1
}}}

Now you can enable this local dojo source version by defining the following in your 
*mysite/settings.py*:

{{{
DOJANGO_DOJO_PROFILE = 'local'
# This version setting is optional! Currently 1.3.1 is the default for that.
# Just showing, how to enable your own dojo source version
DOJANGO_DOJO_VERSION = '1.3.1'
}}}

You are now also able to build your own dojo release (see DojoBuild).


----

For older dojango versions you have to manually download Dojo and copy it to the right place:

The description is based on the dojo version 1.2.3 and it is necessary that you've successfully added dojango to your django project with the instructions from GettingStarted. If you want to use another version you just have to replace 1.2.3 with yours.

{{{
	wget http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.2.3/dojo-release-1.2.3-src.tar.gz
	# or curl http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.2.3/dojo-release-1.2.3-src.tar.gz
	tar xzvf dojo-release-1.2.3-src.tar.gz
	mv dojo-release-1.2.3-src/* mysite/dojango/media/dojo/1.2.3/
	rm -r dojo-release-1.2.3-src*
}}}
